 * libpkg: Pkg as a library, for any program that wants to publish, install
 * or inspect packages without running the command line: a graphical front
 * end, an installer, an IDE plug-in, an agent's tool adapter. The `pkg`
 * command is one client of it among others, and adds nothing but argument
 * parsing, help text and the ARexx port.
 *
 * Each operation takes its options and a sink, and returns a code:
 *
 *   0        done;
 *   10..18   refused, the number naming the class (PKG_RC_*);
 *   20       the request itself is wrong (a missing option, say).
 *
 * The sink receives the answer in one of two forms, chosen by `structured`:
 *
 *   structured = 1   `record` is called once per field, in order, with the
 *                    same keys and values as the command line's MACHINE
 *                    output: a `result` field in every answer, and for a
 *                    refusal `result: refused`, `class`, `code`, `reason`,
 *                    and `next`, what to do now (stop, ask-requester,
 *                    fix-command, check-name, use-upgrade, use-install,
 *                    report). This is the form for programs.
 *   structured = 0   `text` is called with lines written for a person,
 *                    `is_error` set for refusals and warnings.
 *
 * Nothing is written to stdout or stderr, and no environment variable is
 * read: PKG_SIGNKEY, PKG_OUTPUT and PKG_TRACE belong to the command line.
 *
 * `trace`, when set, receives the operation's own account of itself, one
 * line per step, whatever the form: every file read, written, renamed or
 * removed, every check with what was expected and what was found, every
 * choice with its reason (the version picked, what satisfied a dependency,
 * which files were left out, where the architecture came from), and each
 * refusal as it happens. It is for finding out why an operation did what it
 * did; nothing in it is part of the contract, and its wording may change.
 *
 * A decision that belongs to whoever requested the operation (a person, or
 * a supervising agent that holds the authority) is never taken here. A
 * refusal whose `next` is ask-requester (a new signing key, a downgrade, a
 * file someone edited) goes to them; if they agree, the caller repeats the
 * operation with the option that expresses it (acceptkey, downgrade).
 *
 * Trust: a root pins, per package, the key that signed it the first time it
 * was installed there, and refuses another key later (14, ask-requester). The
 * key of a package's first version in a channel is presumed its
 * publisher's: a first install, or a publish, signed by another key is
 * refused the same way. `acceptkey`, with the other key in full, is how the
 * person's confirmation is passed.
 *
 * Linking: `make build/libpkg.a` builds everything, host layer included; a
 * program links that archive and nothing else.
 *
 * One operation runs at a time in a process: the library keeps the state of
 * the running operation in static storage, as the AmigaDOS tools it sits
 * beside do. A front end that runs operations in the background serialises
 * them.
