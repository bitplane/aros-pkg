#   build/aros/afs-handler             rom/filesys/afs, the AROS FFS handler.
#                                      The hosted darwin build ships none, so
#                                      an FFS image cannot mount without it.
#   build/aros/identify/identify.library, Guru, Function
#                                      workbench/libs/identify and its tools.
#                                      Hosted AROS ships no identify.library.
#
# mmake writes into the hosted tree. Every file it adds where a booted system
# looks (L:, Libs:, C:, Locale:) is copied out and then deleted, with the
# directories it created, so the system other runs boot is the one they
# expect. What it adds under Developer/ (identify's headers, fd file and link
# library) stays: nothing boots from there, and deleting generated headers
# left mmake regenerating their dependencies in an endless loop, which is how
# the first version of this script failed.
