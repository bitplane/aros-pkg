# Independent oracles, so this does more than replay what the code intends:
# `shasum -a 256` for digests, `cmp` for installed bytes, `stat` for the key
# file's mode, and channel entries forged by Python rather than by pkg for the
# traversal cases. The forged entries are validly signed, so that what refuses
# them is the path check under test and not a missing signature.
