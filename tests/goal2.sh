# Goal 2: an application arrives, its dependencies arrive by Pkg, it runs, and
# it is checked from outside, with no ARexx anywhere.
#
#   1. On macOS: Guru, the alert decoder that ships with identify.library in
#      the AROS sources, is published as a signed FFS image at 2.0 and 2.1,
#      depending on identify.library, published as a system component. The
#      AROS FFS handler is published as a component too: hosted AROS has none.
#   2. On hosted AROS, one AmigaDOS startup script and nothing else: Pkg
#      bootstraps and installs itself, installs Guru with its dependency,
#      the image is mounted and Guru runs from it, then upgrade, rollback, the
#      refusals, Pkg removed with Guru still running, and last Guru removed
#      and the library taken out as an orphan.
#   3. Every Pkg step runs with MACHINE, and every exit code is read by
#      AmigaDOS into $RC, both checked here against the class table.
#   4. A tampered image and a badly signed dependency are refused, and Guru
#      runs after Pkg has removed itself.
#
# What decides pass or fail is read on the host, from files AROS wrote into
# the share: Guru's output against the strings in its own sources, the
# volume's listing, the root's files, and the exit codes.
#
# Needs: make; sh tools/build-aros.sh; and the AROS FFS handler and the
# identify pieces in build/aros (see README, "Goal 2").
