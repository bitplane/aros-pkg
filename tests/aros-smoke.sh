# First run of the Pkg client on hosted AROS. The channel is published on the
# host by the host build of pkg; the AROS build installs from it, through the
# MacRW: host share, into RAM:, then verifies, lists, copies the installed file
# back out for a byte comparison on the host, removes, and refuses a tampered
# payload. Results are read back on the host, never taken from AROS's word.
#
# Leaves the shared hosted AROS tree as it found it, and refuses to run while
# another instance is up.
