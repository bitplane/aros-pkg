# RESOLVE's prediction against the real loader, on hosted AROS. Two builds
# of one library, pkgtest.library 1.0 and 2.30 (tools/build-aros-testlib.sh),
# and C:TestLib, which really calls OpenLibrary() and prints the version it
# got. Each boot starts with nothing loaded:
#
#   boot 1  a file with no resident tag first in the path, 2.30 in SYS:Libs:
#           RESOLVE says the file is passed over and SYS:Libs taken; TestLib
#           gets 2.30. Then RESOLVE reports the copy in memory.
#   boot 2  1.0 in the program's libs/, 2.30 in SYS:Libs: RESOLVE says libs/
#           is taken; TestLib gets 1.0. Then RESOLVE reports the loaded 1.0 as
#           the winner even from another directory, and with VERSION 2.30
#           refuses (18), telling to flush it.
#
# What AROS did is read back on the host. Leaves the hosted tree as it found
# it, and refuses to run while another instance is up.
